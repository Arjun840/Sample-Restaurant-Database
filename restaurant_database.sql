--Q4: Reflection
-- We started out with a rough idea of making a database for the restaurant industry, including relationships 
-- between restaurants, suppliers and customers. Our first ERD was fairly simple, and after feedback, we expanded 
-- it to include more important columns and have a clearer organization. One of the biggest useful things that we 
-- learned during this process was how to take a rough concept for a database and materialize it into one that would 
-- actually be fully usable. One of the challenges of the process was deciding on the columns for each table. Every 
-- table we included could have included many more columns if we wanted that to be a part of the designâ€”for example, 
-- MenuItem could have a column Silverware that specifies whether a dish needs to be served with a fork/spoon/knife/chopsticks/etc. 
-- Because each table could have endless columns, we did our best to consolidate each one to only the most necessary columns that 
-- provide important information about each entry and help connect the table to the other tables as needed. Another challenge was 
-- deciding how to translate our ERD diagram into SQL code, such as the relationships between tables. We worked through this by working 
-- together in person on the programming and going through different implementation options to see what would work best.
